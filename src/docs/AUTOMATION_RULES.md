## LinkedIn (Production Ready)

### What's Working

- ✅ Login with session persistence
- ✅ Like posts
- ✅ Comment on posts (with human-like delays)
- ✅ Send messages (1st connections)
- ✅ Connection requests (2nd degree — direct button)
- ✅ Connection requests (3rd degree — via More dropdown)
- ✅ Search for posts by keyword
- ✅ Profile detection and degree identification
- ✅ Notifications on action completion

### CLI Commands

```bash
clawsocial linkedin connect <profile-url>     # Send connection request
clawsocial linkedin like <post-url>           # Like a post
clawsocial linkedin comment <post-url> "text" # Comment on post
clawsocial linkedin message <profile-url> "text" # Send DM
clawsocial linkedin search "query"            # Search posts
clawsocial linkedin engage --query "openclaw" # Full engagement session
```

### Connection Request Flow

1. Navigate to profile
2. Wait for profile header to load (retry loop, up to 10 attempts)
3. Detect button state:
   - **2nd degree**: Direct "Connect" button visible → click
   - **3rd degree**: "Connect" hidden in "More" dropdown → click More → click Connect
4. Handle connection modal (add note if provided)
5. Send request
6. Emit notification

## Instagram (Production Ready)

### What's Working

- ✅ Login with session persistence
- ✅ Follower scraping from target account
- ✅ Like posts
- ✅ Comment on posts
- ✅ Follow users
- ✅ Follow-back (users with no posts)
- ✅ Notifications on action completion

### CLI Commands

```bash
clawsocial instagram like <post-url>
clawsocial instagram comment <post-url> "text"
clawsocial instagram follow <username>
```

### Engagement Script

```bash
# Scrape followers and engage
cd /home/sonofanton/projects/clawsocial
npx tsx src/scripts/ig-engage.ts --max=1

# Skip scrape, use existing state
npx tsx src/scripts/ig-engage.ts --skip-scrape --max=1
```

---

## Twitter/X (Use bird CLI)

**Do not use ClawSocial for Twitter/X.** Use the `bird` CLI instead:

- Cookie-based authentication (no API needed)
- Tested for 7+ days with no errors
- Supports: timeline, mentions, search, post, reply, like, bookmarks

```bash
# Usage
bird whoami
bird home -n 8
bird mentions -n 5
bird search "clawdbot OR openclaw" -n 30
bird tweet "Hello world"
bird reply <tweet-url> "response"
```

## 🔥 Warm-Up Schedule (CRITICAL)

New accounts or accounts starting automation MUST warm up gradually.

### Week 1: Light Activity

| Day | Likes | Comments | Connects/Follows | DMs  |
| --- | ----- | -------- | ---------------- | ---- |
| 1   | 0-2   | 0        | 0                | 0    |
| 2   | 2-4   | 0-1      | 0                | 0    |
| 3   | 4-6   | 1-2      | 0-1              | 0    |
| 4   | 6-8   | 2-3      | 1-2              | 0-1  |
| 5   | 8-12  | 3-5      | 2-3              | 1-2  |
| 6   | 12-16 | 5-8      | 3-5              | 2-4  |
| 7   | 16-20 | 8-14     | 5-10             | 4-10 |

**Week 1 Maximums:** 20 likes, 14 comments, 10 connects, 10 DMs

### Weekly Progression

| Week | Likes | Comments | Connects | DMs | Increase |
| ---- | ----- | -------- | -------- | --- | -------- |
| 1    | 20    | 14       | 10       | 10  | Baseline |
| 2    | 25    | 18       | 13       | 13  | +25%     |
| 3    | 32    | 22       | 16       | 16  | +25%     |
| 4    | 40    | 28       | 20       | 20  | +25%     |
| 5+   | 100   | 30       | 50       | 50  | Full     |

**LinkedIn Exception:** Keep connection requests ≤15/day even at full limits.

## ⏰ Timing Rules (MANDATORY)

### Minimum Gaps

| Action              | Minimum Gap |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| Comments            | 10 minutes  |
| Connection requests | 15 minutes  |
| Likes               | 5 minutes   |
| DMs                 | 10 minutes  |

### Time Formatting

- ✅ **Use odd minutes:** :03, :07, :11, :17, :23, :33, :41, :47, :51, :53
- ❌ **Never use rounded:** :00, :05, :10, :15, :30, :45

### Daily Distribution

Spread actions across active hours (8am-10pm):

**Good Pattern:**

```
08:17 — 2 likes
10:33 — 1 comment, 1 like
12:07 — 1 connection request
13:41 — 2 likes, 1 comment
15:23 — 1 like
17:51 — 1 connection request
19:07 — 1 comment
21:33 — 2 likes
```

**Bad Pattern:**

```
10:00 — 10 likes
10:05 — 5 comments
10:10 — 5 connections
```

### Delay Variation

- Never use the same delay twice in a row
- Vary between 10-25 minutes for comments
- Vary between 15-30 minutes for connections
- Random jitter on all timings

---

## 🚨 Warning Signs

**Stop immediately if you see:**

- "Action Blocked" messages
- CAPTCHA challenges
- Temporary restrictions
- Unusual logout prompts
- Email verification requests

**Recovery:**

1. Stop all automation for 24-48 hours
2. Use account manually (browse, scroll)
3. Resume at 50% of previous limits
4. Increase by 10% weekly until stable

---

## Human-like Behavior (Built-in)

ClawSocial implements:

- **Warm-up browsing**: Scrolls feed before actions
- **Random delays**: 1.5-4s between micro-actions
- **Natural typing**: 30-100ms per character
- **Thinking pauses**: 2-5s before complex actions
- **Profile viewing**: Simulates reading before engaging
- **Button detection retry**: Waits for page load, retries up to 10x

---
